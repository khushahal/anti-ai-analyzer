## 🎯 Key Features Explained

### AI Mistake Detection
The system categorizes AI mistakes into several types:
- **Factual Errors**: Incorrect information or data
- **Logical Fallacies**: Flawed reasoning or arguments
- **Bias Issues**: Gender, racial, or other forms of bias
- **Context Errors**: Misunderstanding of context or incomplete responses

### Performance Metrics
Each AI tool is evaluated on:
- **Accuracy**: Percentage of correct responses
- **Response Time**: Speed of response generation
- **Mistake Rate**: Frequency of errors
- **Cost Efficiency**: Cost per query
- **Reliability**: System uptime and consistency

### Real-time Monitoring
- Simulated real-time data updates every 3 seconds
- Live connection status indicators
- Event filtering and categorization
- Real-time statistics and counters

## 🎨 UI/UX Features

- **Modern Design**: Clean, professional interface with gradient accents
- **Responsive Layout**: Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- **Interactive Elements**: Hover effects, animations, and smooth transitions
- **Color-coded System**: Different colors for different types of events and severity levels
